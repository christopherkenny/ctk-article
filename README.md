# ctk-article Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template christopherkenny/ctk-article
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

## Fonts

By default, the `ctk-article` format uses the Crimson Text font. This can be installed from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text).

To check that it is installed, run:

```
quarto typst fonts
```

If no font by the names "Crimson Text", "Crimson", or "Crimson Pro" is found, the template falls back to Linux Libertine.

This font is chosen to look like [Cory McCartan's cmc-article](https://github.com/corymccartan/cmc-article) which uses Cochineal.


## Using

_TODO_: Describe how to use your format.
